  So you have one project on github and another on bitbucket and you want
  different SSH keys for each project. 


  Github's docs say to add this to your `.ssh/config` file

  ```bash
  Host *
    AddKeysToAgent yes
    UseKeychain yes
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
  ```


  But, if you add a new record to this file with a HostName set


  ```bash
  Host bitbucket.com
    AddKeysToAgent yes
    UseKeychain yes
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_bitbucket_rsa
  ```


  you can tell SSH to use this ssh identity for `bitbucket.com` and fall back to the default otherwise. 


  You could even be more specific and do 

  ```bash
  Host github.com
    AddKeysToAgent yes
    UseKeychain yes
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_github_rsa

  Host bitbucket.com
    AddKeysToAgent yes
    UseKeychain yes
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_bitbucket_rsa
  ```


  You can even alias these using the host name if you're using github for both personal and work


  ```bash
  Host github_personal
    HostName github.com
    AddKeysToAgent yes
    UseKeychain yes
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_github_personal_rsa

  Host github_work
    HostName github.com
    AddKeysToAgent yes
    UseKeychain yes
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_github_work_rsa
  ```


  so now instead of your remote origin being


  `remote.origin.url=git@github.com:madole/very-important-project.git`


  its either


  **Personal**


  `remote.origin.url=git@github_personal/very-important-project.git`


  or


  **Work**


  `remote.origin.url=git@github_work/very-important-project.git`
