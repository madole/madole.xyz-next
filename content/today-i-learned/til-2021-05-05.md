The `<del>` element represents text that has been removed from a document and
the `<ins>` represents text which has been added. This can be used when
rendering "track changes" or source code diff information.

```html
This look like <del>I got deleted</del> <ins>in favour of this</ins>
```

This look like <del>I got deleted</del> <ins>in favour of this</ins>
