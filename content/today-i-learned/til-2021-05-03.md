  Pythagoreanism was a religious sect/cult/philosophic tradition which
  originated in Ancient Greece in the 6th century BC, based on the teachings and
  beliefs held by Pythagoras and his followers, the Pythagoreans.


  Pythagoreans believed that body and soul functioned together, and a healthy body required a healthy psyche. 


  Early Pythagoreans conceived of the soul as the seat of sensation and emotion. They regarded the soul as distinct from the intellect. They believed that after the death of the body, the soul would be punished or rewarded.


  The highest reward a human could attain was for the soul to join in the life of the gods and thus escaped the cycle of reincarnation in another human body.


  They were vegetarians and believed that animals did not need to be harmed to have a healthy diet. 


  Pythagoreans believed in a *musica universalis*. They reasoned that stars must produce a sound because they were large swiftly moving bodies. Pythagoreans also determined that stars revolved at distances and speeds that were proportional to each other. They reasoned that because of this numerical proportion the revolution of the stars produced a harmonic sound
