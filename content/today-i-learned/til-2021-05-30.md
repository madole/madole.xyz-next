An old saying that hinted at pear trees taking a long time to fruit if grown from their own roots. Sometimes six years until they bear fruit.

But you can graft them onto established quince rootstocks to get a tree which will fruit in three to four years. It also produces a smaller tree which is perfect for a home garden.
