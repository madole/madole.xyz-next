title: FormData won't pickup disabled form items and checkboxes don't have a
  readonly state

Consider a form which has a checkbox that the checked state is controlled by
something else. Maybe a "Select/Deselect All" option. Here's a snippet where
I've just hardcoded the value of the checkbox input.

```html
<form>
  <label for="is-chicken">🐔?</label>
  <input name="is-chicken" type="checkbox" checked disabled />
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

<script>
  const form = document.querySelector("form");

  form.onsubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    const formData = new FormData(e.currentTarget);
    const isChicken = formData.get("is-chicken");
    console.log(isChicken); // null
  };
</script>
```

I want to make sure that I can block the user from interacting with the checkbox and yet still read the value.

Maybe `readonly` would work?

```html
<form>
  <label for="is-chicken">🐔?</label>
  <input name="is-chicken" type="checkbox" checked readonly />
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

<script>
  const form = document.querySelector("form");

  form.onsubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    const formData = new FormData(e.currentTarget);
    const isChicken = formData.get("is-chicken");
    console.log(isChicken); // on
  };
</script>
```

MDN says

> The `readonly` attribute is supported by  `text`, `search`, `url`, `tel`, `email`, `password`, `date`, `month`, `week`, `time`, `datetime-local`, and `number<input>` types and the `<textarea>` form control elements. If present on any of these input types and elements, the `:read-only` pseudo class will match. If the attribute is not included, the `:read-write` pseudo class will match.

>

> The attribute is not supported or relevant to `<select>` or input types that are already not mutable, such as [checkbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/checkbox) and [radio](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/radio) or cannot, by definition, start with a value, such as the [file](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file)  input type. [range](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/range) and [color](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/color), as both have default values. It is also not supported on [hidden](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/hidden) as it can not be expected that a user to fill out a form that is hidden. Nor is it supported on any of the button types, including `image`.

When up against this set of requirements, maybe there's a better away to solve the problem.
