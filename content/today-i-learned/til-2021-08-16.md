For years I've seen Qt around the place, I've even worked on building set-top box UIs built on top of Qt-Webkit.

All this time I've just assumed it is pronounced "Q T", until today when I was combing through [Github Topics](https://github.com/topics) and I spot this.

So here we are, "Qt, pronounced 'cute', is a cross-platform application development framework."
