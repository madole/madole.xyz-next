Did you know that often you can pop the console of a JS library website to demo the library?

This is a great way to quickly test out a library without having to set up a project or write any code.

## Examples

---

### Decimal.js
For example, in [Decimal.js](https://mikemcl.github.io/decimal.js/) you can pop the console and run:

```js
> const a = new Decimal(0.1)

> const b = new Decimal(0.2)

> a.plus(b).toNumber()

0.3
```

### Lodash
At [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) you can run:

```js
_.difference(['a','b','c'], ['b','c'])

['a']
```

### Moment.js

At [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) you can run:

```js
moment().format('MMMM Do YYYY, h:mm:ss a')

'August 13th 2024, 11:16:55 am'
```

### Date-fns

At [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) you can run:

```js
// init date-fns on the page
init()

// use the _ object to access date-fns functions
_.addDays(new Date(), 5)

'Sun Aug 18 2024 11:18:39 GMT+1000 (Australian Eastern Standard Time)'
```

Date Fns even prompts you from within the console.

So next time you're checking out a JS library, remember to pop the console and give it a spin!
