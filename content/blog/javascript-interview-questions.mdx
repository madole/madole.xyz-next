I was asked recently by a friend of mine to come up with a list of interview questions that you can get asked during
a Javascript interview. I looked by to my last interview and came up with a few topics for him to brush up on.
I thought I'd write them down so others might make use of them. If you were asked anything I've not included, let me
know in the comments section.

We'll start easy...

###What is Javascript?
Mozilla Developer Network describes Javascript as:

> JavaScriptÂ® (often shortened to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions,
> most known as the scripting language for Web pages, but used in many non-browser environments as well such as node.js
> or Apache CouchDB. It is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm scripting language that is dynamic,and supports
> object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.

The standards for Javascript are written in the ECMAScript documents. Currently we're on ES5 but ES6 has just been
locked down so I'm looking forward to checking out some of the goodies it has to offer such as native promises and
modules and classes.

###What is variable scoping?
Variable scoping in Javascript can get complicated so lets do some examples.

####Globally scoped variable

```javascript
var a = 1;

function test() {
  console.log(a); //1
}
```

####Locally scoped variable

```javascript
function test() {
  var a = 1;
  console.log(a); //1
}
```

####Closure

The return function still has access to the internal variable by trapping it in the closure.
This is one of the great features of closures. More on this later.

```javascript
var close = (function () {
  var a = 1;
  return function () {
    console.log(a); //1
  };
})();

close();
```

####Implicit Globals _WATCH OUT FOR THESE_

This is where you don't declare a variable but then set it, these automatically go into the global scope.
It is worth while checking for implicit globally scoped variables every now and again in your javascript
because they can cause issues where things don't seem to act like they should.

```javascript
function test() {
  a = 1;
}

console.log(a); //1
```

##What does variable hoisting mean in Javascript?
Javascript has a way of hoisting variable declarations to the top of the function. This can produce some unexpected
results if you are not aware of it them.

```javascript
(function () {
  if (true) {
    var x = 5;
  }
  console.log(x); //5
})();
```

The above example is interpreted exactly the same as this

```javascript
(function () {
  var x;
  if (true) {
    x = 5;
  }
  console.log(x); //5
})();
```

Where this gets confusing is in an example like this

```javascript
var x = 100;

function test() {
  if (false) {
    var x = 199;
  }
  console.log(x); //undefined
}

test();
```

What's going on here? Well we've declared x outside the function text and set it to 100.
Inside the test function, the interpreter has seen there's a variable declaration, ignored the fact that it
is inside a code block and hoisted it to the top of the function scope. The condition is not met so x  
 has not been set to 199 and remains to have a value of 'undefined'

It is the same as writing

```javascript
var x = 100;

function test() {
  var x;
  if (false) {
    x = 199;
  }
  console.log(x); //undefined
}

test();
```

##What is the difference between `==` and `===` in Javascript?

Double equals checks equality whereas triple equals checks equality and type. What does this mean?

```javascript
//==

3 == 3; //true
"3" == 3; //true
3 == "3"; //true

//===
3 === 3; //true
"3" === 3; //false
3 === "3"; //false
```

##What kind of conditional statements are available in Javascript

####if statement

```javascript
if (x === 1) {
  //...
}
```

####if else statement

```javascript
if (x === 1) {
  //...
} else {
  //...
}
```

####if else if statement

```javascript
if (x === 1) {
  //...
} else if (y === 1) {
  //...
}
```

####switch statement

```javascript
switch (x) {
  case 1:
    console.log("one");
    break;
  case 2:
    console.log("two");
    break;
  case 3:
    console.log("three");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("This is the default condition");
    break;
}
```

##What would the following if condition example check for

```javascript
if (!condition) {
  //...
}
```

This would satisfy if

```
condition==='undefined' or
condition===null  or
condition===0     or
condition===""    or
condition===NaN   or
condition===false.
```

This is a common way of checking for null or undefined but you have to double check that your variable
would not ever be set to false or 0 because it will also satisfy.

##What kind of loops are available in Javascript?
####for loop
You can see in the second loop, we cache the length of the array so we don't need to calculate the length of the
array each iteration. Micro-performance improvement that can add up over time, although newer Javascript engines like
V8 will more than likely JIT compile for loops automatically into their most efficient form.

```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  //do stuff
}

for (var i = 0, l = arr.length; i < l; i++) {
  //do stuff
}
```

####for in loop

```javascript
for (var x in arr) {
  //do stuff
}
```

####while loop

```javascript
while (x === true) {
  //do stuff
}
```

####do while loop
NOTE: This does one full iteration before checking the condition

```javascript
do {
  //do stuff
} while (x === true);
```

##What different ways can you create an Array in Javascript?
The following examples show you different ways to create an array in Javascript

```javascript
var arr1 = new Array();
arr1.push("Me");
arr1.push("You");
arr1.push("Them");

var arr2 = new Array();
arr2[0] = "Me";
arr2[1] = "You";
arr2[2] = "Them";

var arr3 = new Array("Me", "You", "Them");

var arr4 = [];
arr4.push("Me");
arr4.push("You");
arr4.push("Them");

var arr5 = [];
arr5[0] = "Me";
arr5[1] = "You";
arr5[2] = "Them";

var arr6 = ["Me", "You", "Them"];
```

###How do you write an immediately invoked function?
If you were to write the following code, it would assign the function to the var addFirstFiveNumbers.
In order to access the return value, you would have to execute the function.

```javascript
var addFirstFiveNumbers = function () {
  var count = 0;
  for (var i = 0; i <= 5; i++) {
    count += i;
  }
  return count;
};

console.log(addFirstFiveNumbers()); //15
```

If you wanted the function to execute immediately and store the return value in the var instead of the function,
you use an immediately invoked function. To do this, wrap your function in parenthesis and put a set of empty
parenthesis after it

```javascript
var addFirstSixNumbers = (function () {
  var count = 0;
  for (var j = 0; j <= 6; j++) {
    count += j;
  }
  return count;
})();

console.log(addFirstSixNumbers); //21
```

##How can you handle errors in Javascript?
####Try Catch statements
These allow you to throw errors inside the try and catch them in the catch block

```javascript
try {
  //do stuff
  throw "My Error";
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e);
}
```

####Try Finally statements
These allow your code to fail gracefully by performing some clean up task after your code has finished executing or failing.

```javascript
openMyFile();
try {
  //tie up the resource
  writeTofile();
} finally {
  //release the resource
  closeMyFile();
}
```

####Try Catch Conditional statements - THESE ARE NON STANDARD (and do not work in V8)

```javascript
try {
    //do stuff
    myRoutine(); //may throw three exceptions
} catch(e if e instanceof TypeError) {
    //handle type errors
} catch(e if e instanceof RangeError) {
    //handle range errors
} catch(e if e instanceof EvalError) {
    //handle eval errors
} catch (e) {
    logMyErrors(e);
}
```

##How would you execute a function in 30 seconds time?

####Set Timeout

```javascript
var timeout = setTimeout(function () {
  //code to be executed in 30 seconds
}, 30000);

//To cancel this timeout
clearTimeout(timeout);
```

##How would you execute a piece of code every 10 seconds?

####Set Interval

```javascript
var interval = setInterval(function () {
  //Code to be executed every 10 seconds
}, 10000);

//To remove this setInterval
clearInterval(interval);
```

##Explain Inheritance in Javascript

MDN explains:

> Inheritance is a way to create a class as a specialized version of one or more classes (JavaScript only supports
> single inheritance). The specialized class is commonly called the child, and the other class is commonly called the
> parent. In JavaScript you do this by assigning an instance of the parent class to the child class, and then
> specializing it. In modern browsers you can also use Object.create to implement inheritance.

### Difference between Object.create and the new operator

Both are ways to inherit from a base class, but Object.create inherits from the prototype. What does this mean? Well lets
do an example.

```javascript
function Person() {
  this.species = "human";
}

Person.prototype.speak = function () {
  console.log("Hello");
};

Person.prototype.sleep = function () {
  console.log("Snore...zzz");
};

var andrew = new Person();
console.log(andrew.species); //human
andrew.speak(); //Hello
andrew.sleep(); //Snore...zzz

var andy = Object.create(Person.prototype);
console.log(andy.species); //undefined
andy.speak(); //Hello
andy.sleep(); //Snore...zzz
```

Here, Andrew is an instance of the Person class and so has species set on it. Andy on the other hand has inherited
from the Person class's prototype _only_ and so has access to the prototype functions of the Person class but
none of the attributes set on the class.

##What is the difference between .call() and .apply()

At first you might think they do the same thing. Take a _this_ arg and pass it to a function, lets see that
in action

```javascript
var car1 = { make: "Vauxhall", model: "Corsa", year: "2005" };
var car2 = { make: "Bugatti", model: "Veyron", year: "2014" };

var printMake = function () {
  console.log(this.make);
};

var printModel = function () {
  console.log(this.model);
};

printMake.call(car1); //Vauxhall
printMake.apply(car1); //Vauxhall

printMake.call(car2); //Bugatti
printMake.apply(car2); //Bugatti

printModel.call(car1); //Corsa
printModel.apply(car1); //Corsa

printModel.call(car2); //Veyron
printModel.apply(car2); //Veyron
```

Where .call() and .apply() differ is the arguments you pass after the _this_ arg.

In a .call(), you pass your _this_ arg
then followed by the args the function is expecting.

In a .apply(), you pass your _this_ arg followed by an array containing the arguments to be passed which then get split
out into the function params.

Lets see these in action

```javascript
var car1 = { make: "Vauxhall", model: "Corsa", year: "2005" };
var car2 = { make: "Bugatti", model: "Veyron", year: "2014" };

var udpateCar = function (make, model, year) {
  this.make = make;
  this.model = model;
  this.year = year;
};

udpateCar.call(car1, "Vauxhall", "Astra", "2014");
udpateCar.apply(car2, ["Mini", "Cooper", "2014"]);

console.log(car1); //{ make: 'Vauxhall', model: 'Astra', year: '2014' }
console.log(car2); //{ make: 'Mini', model: 'Cooper', year: '2014' }
```

##How would you go about dealing with an asynchronous request?

####Deferred promises
jQuery and Q both provide a way to do promises and ECMAScript6 will provide a way to do native Javascript promises.

Lets look at the jQuery Deferred object.

```javascript
function asyncFunction() {
    var defer = $.Deferred();
    $.ajax({
        url: 'https://getPerson.com/?gender=female'
        context: this
    }).done(function (returnObj) {
        defer.resolve(returnObj);
    }).fail(function () {
        defer.reject();
    });
    return defer.promise();
}

function myFunction() {
    var personPromise = asyncFunction();
    personPromise.done(function (returnObj) { //executes when promise is resolved
            console.log(returnObj.name)
        });
    personPromise.fail(function () { //executes when promise is rejected
            console.log('Failed to get the person');
        });
}

myFunction();
```

myFunction is calling the asyncFunction and getting a deferred promise back. When the promise
gets resolved after the ajax request returns, the done function will get executed. If the promise gets rejected, the fail
function will get executed.

These are useful when you are making calls out to a webservice for data.

##Some Javascript shortcuts/hacks

####Ternary operators

These are great for situations where you want to assign a var based on a condition.

test ? expression1 : expression2

You can play with these here at [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/madole404/KdnJ7/)

```javascript
function returnTrueIfLessThanTen(checkVal) {
  var returnVal = checkVal < 10 ? true : false;
  return returnVal;
}
console.log(returnTrueIfLessThanTen(9)); //true
console.log(returnTrueIfLessThanTen(29)); //false
```

###Using bitwise operators in place of Math.floor

You can have a play with these and see them in action at [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/madole404/g34mL/)

#####Why use them?
They are marginally faster than Math.floor as we can see from this [JSPerf](https://jsperf.com/math-floor-vs-math-round-vs-parseint/70)

#####Why not to use them?

- They reduce clarity in your coding
- They only work 32-bit signed integers
- They work by truncating the decimal rather than working out what the floor is
- You might not get the outcome you are expecting
  - `Math.floor(NaN) === NaN`
  - `(NaN >> 0) === 0`

####Using bitwise operators in place of Math.floor

You can have a play with these and see them in action at [JSFiddle.net](https://jsfiddle.net/madole404/g34mL/)

```javascript
var result = 84.3 / 12.5;
console.log(result); //6.744

var round = Math.round(84.3 / 12.5);
console.log(round); //7

var floor = Math.floor(84.3 / 12.5);
console.log(floor); //6

var doubleNeg = ~~(84.3 / 12.5);
console.log(doubleNeg); //6

var bitwiseRight = (84.3 / 12.5) >> 0;
console.log(bitwiseRight); //6

var bitwiseLeft = (84.3 / 12.5) << 0;
console.log(bitwiseLeft); //6

var bitwiseOr = (84.3 / 12.5) | 0;
console.log(bitwiseOr); //6

var parseInteger = parseInt(84.3 / 12.5);
console.log(parseInteger); //6
```
