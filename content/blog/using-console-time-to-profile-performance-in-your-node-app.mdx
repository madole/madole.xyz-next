I was writing an express application, when I started to notice one of the routes was taking quite a while to respond to a request. The route was doing some heavy lifting shaping data from an API .

I needed to figure out where the bottleneck was and optimise it.

**How do I start to figure out how and where to optimise?**

I could run the V8 profiler (https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/simple-profiling/), pipe the result into a file, load that into Chrome and look at the metric table and flame graph. But I find this to be too low level when I know roughly the area that the bottleneck is happening in.

Node provides two api's to deal with this. (https://nodejs.org/api/console.html)

> `console.time(label)`

> Starts a timer that can be used to compute the duration of an operation. Timers are identified by a unique label. Use the same label when you call console.timeEnd() to stop the timer and output the elapsed time in milliseconds to stdout. Timer durations are accurate to the sub-millisecond.

> `console.timeEnd(label)`

> Stops a timer that was previously started by calling console.time() and prints the result to stdout

To use these, put a `console.time('label')` before the function you want to profile and a `console.timeEnd('label')` after it and then run your app.

Here's an example of profiling native `Array.prototype.map` and `Array.prototype.filter` against their lodash counterparts on an array of a million values:

```javascript
const _ = require("lodash");
const dataset = [];
for (let i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
  dataset.push(i);
}

console.time("map");
const squared = dataset.map((x) => x * x);
console.timeEnd("map");

console.time("lodash map");
const lodashSquared = _.map(dataset, (x) => x * x);
console.timeEnd("lodash map");

console.time("filter");
const filtered = dataset.filter((x) => x % 2 === 0);
console.timeEnd("filter");

console.time("lodash filter");
const lodashFiltered = _.filter(dataset, (x) => x % 2 === 0);
console.timeEnd("lodash filter");
```

The output to the console looks like this:

```bash
$ map: 199.207ms
$ lodash map: 16.889ms
$ filter: 123.355ms
$ lodash filter: 21.634ms
```

That's a pretty insane time savings on Node v6.1.0. And this could help you squeeze a bit more performance out of your application.

If you're in the browser, some of them have built in similar tools to give you more information. (https://github.com/DeveloperToolsWG/console-object/blob/master/api.md#consoleprofilelabel)

> `console.profile(label)`

> Calling this function initiates a JavaScript CPU profile with an optional label. To complete the profile, call console.profileEnd().

> `console.profileEnd(label)`

> Stops the current JavaScript CPU profiling session, if one is in progress, and prints the report to the Profiles panel.
