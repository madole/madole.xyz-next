I decided to write down a list of every day commands that I use in the the Bash command line in Linux.
This is by no means a definitive list and it will grow as I remember or come across commands that make
my life easier

### ls

-       list information about files in the directory

### ls -la

-       list information about files in the directory
-       *-l* means long listing format
-       *-a* means list all files including ones that start with .

### cd [directory]

-       change directory to the specified directory

### ps

-       snapshot of the current processes

### ps -ef

-       *-e* select all processes
-       *-f* full format listing

### ps -ef | grep [processname]

-       grep for the details of a specific process

### alias (usually used in the bash profile to be persisted)

-   _ll -> ls -la_
-   Aliases for shortcuts to frequently visited directories
-   Aliases to bash scripts I've written to automate things like sync'ing a github pages branch with master and pushing to the cloud

### source [filename]

-       source is a bash shell built-in command that executes the content of the file passed as argument, in the current shell. It has a synonym in '.' (period).

### source ~/.bash_profile

-       this has the effect of reloading the bash_profile so you don't have to kill & open the terminal to see changes

### &&

-       used for tying consecutive commands together
-       example *$ cd Documents && ls -la*

### &

-   Can be used to run two tasks in parallel, the first tasks gets backgrounded

### top

-       Provides a real time summary of the processes running on your system.
-       Can be used to see what's chewing up memory

### Ctrl + R

-       Reverse search through your bash command history

### sudo

-   run command as the superuser

### sudo -u [user]

-   run command as a different user

### sudo !!

-   run the last command as super user

### vi [file]

-       edit the file with vi text editor
