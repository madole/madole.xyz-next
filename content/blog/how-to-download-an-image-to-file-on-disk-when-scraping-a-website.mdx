Recently I was recovering data from one of my websites that had been unceremoniously taken down while I was on holidays when I got stomped for a little while on how to scrape an image and save it to file using NodeJS.

Letâ€™s say you are using puppeteer and you have the image URL for the image you want to save to disk.

I knew I could use the `fs.writeFile`but I was trying to figure out how to get it from a http response to something that I could write to file. I tried to parse it into a blob, but then I discovered you can just pipe the response body directly into `fs.createWriteStream`. My code ended up looking like this:

```javascript
const imageUrl =
  "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1601143240380-10dfad37660d?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=800&q=60";
const imageDirAndName = "./downloaded-img.jpg";

fetch(imageUrl)
  .then((response) =>
    response.body
      .pipe(fs.createWriteStream(imageDirAndName))
      .on("close", () => console.log("image downloaded")),
  )
  .catch((err) => console.error(err.stack));
```
