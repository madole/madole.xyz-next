## What is Gatsby?

> ðŸ”¥ Blazing-fast static site generator for React

It's is perfect for a static blog, it reads markdown and gives you a GraphQL API to query it and a React front end.

Coupled with https://www.netlify.com/, it is a fantastic solution from development to deployment.

I've used Ghost for my blogs for years but I decided to migrate across recently. So how did I do it?

Ghost allows your to export your data in a big JSON blob. So the question is _how do you turn this into something that Gatsby can consume?_

### Parse that shiz

I wrote a small node app to take the data exported by Ghost and parse it into the markdown files/folders that Gatsby expects.

First of all, you have to look at the fomat of a gastby blog post.

```markdown
---
title: Hello world
date: 2016-04-15T14:32:57.000Z
slug: /hello-world/
---

### I'm a blog title

And I'm some text
```

Then have a look at what Ghost exports.

I was using an older version of Ghost so the exact format might have changed but here was the gist of my output.

```javascript
{
	"db": [
		"data": {
			"posts": [
				{
					published_at: "2018-06-18T10:09:09",
					slug: "hello-world",
					markdown: "# I'm a blog title\n And I'm some text",
					title: "Hello world"
				}
			]
		}
	]
}
```

So to begin parsing, I first made an ES6 template string in the shape of the output format.

```javascript
const template = `---
title: "${title}"
date: "${published_at}"
slug: "/${slug}/"
---
${markdown}
`;
```

Then I realised that the published_at date is in the wrong format so I had to parse that into the correct format so

```javascript
date: '${published_at}';
```

becomes

```javascript
date: '${new Date(published_at).toISOString()}';
```

I want to put these in a folder which I've already made called _blog-posts_

```bash
$ mkdir blog-posts
```

And I want each blog post to go into a folder named in the format `{year}-{month}-{day}-{slug}` as I'll be calling the markdown files `index.md`.

So to do this, I've used `fs.mkdirSync`. I'm not too worried about speed here so I've opted for the simpler synchronous implementation version of `fs.mkdir`.

```javascript
const publishedAt = new Date(published_at);
const day = publishedAt.getDate();
const month = publishedAt.getMonth() + 1; // months go from 0 (jan) to 11 (dec) so pad by 1
const year = publishedAt.getFullYear();
const folderName = `${year}-${month}-${day}-${slug}`;

fs.mkdirSync(`./blog-posts/${folderName}`);
```

All that's left to do now is to write the filled template to file within our new folder. Again, I've opted for the syncronous version of `fs.writeFile` for simplicity.

```javascript
fs.writeFileSync(`./blog-posts/${folderName}/index.md`, template, 'utf8');
```

I put all of this inside a function called `parseBlogPost` and passed it into the `forEach` on the posts.

```javascript
blog.db[0].data.posts.forEach(parseBlogPost);
```

The code is available in [Github](https://github.com/madole/ghost-to-gatsby-parser), feel free to fork it and update it for future versions of Ghost if you want.
