## Yarn Berry

Yarn berry is the codename for Yarn version 2 and 3. It worked so differently to Yarn 1 that the team ended
up giving it a totally different name. The main difference is that Yarn berry uses a feature called PnP(Plug'n'Play)
to install and resolve dependencies.

## The big impact
There are no `node_modules` in your project directory.

You can read more about why there are no `node_modules` in the [Yarn PnP documentation](https://yarnpkg.com/features/pnp).
But it boils down to yarn shifting responsibilty of resolving dependencies from NodeJS to the package manager.

## The problem
Webstorm does have existing support for PnP when you're coding ðŸŽ‰ but as of January 2020,
it doesn't know were to look for the ESlint plugin when you've got no node_modules.

## The solution
- We need to "unplug" ESLint, which means that the package gets unzipped in your `.yarn` directory into an `unplugged` folder.
    - The command for this is `yarn unplug eslint`
- To find out where the eslint binary now lives, we run `yarn bin eslint`.
    - This will give us the fully qualified path to the eslint binary
    - `[path to your project]/.yarn/unplugged/eslint-npm-8.6.0-f5ecfc9f69/node_modules/eslint/bin/eslint.js`
- We want to remove `/bin/eslint.js` from the end of that path and copy that to your clipboard
- Now we can go to the Webstorm settings <kbd>Cmd+,</kbd> and navigate to the ESLint section
    - Languages & Frameworks > Javascript > Code Quality Tools > ESLint
- Now choose `Manual ESLint configuration`
- Now paste the previously copied path into the `ESLint package` field

That's it, Webstorm is now ready to shout at you when you've forgotten a semicolon.
