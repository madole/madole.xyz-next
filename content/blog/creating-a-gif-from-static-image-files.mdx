Today I wanted to create a gif of some weather imagery I exported from QGIS. I was able to use the timeline functionality in QGIS to export individual static frames for each timestamp of weather data I had.

For example, I've got a bunch of images like the ones below

![Map screenshot of Australia with thunderstorm forecast overlaid on it - one
  of two](/blog-images/creating-a-gif/0000.jpg)

![Map screenshot of Australia with thunderstorm forecast overlaid on it - two of
two](/blog-images/creating-a-gif/0045.jpg)

To take these and turn them into an
animated gif on a Mac, I must first install imagemagick.

```bash
brew install imagemagick
```

Then I can invoke imagemagick's convert function and tell it all the images I want to include in the animation and an output file.

```bash
magick *.png animation.gif
```

And you end up with something like

![Animation of thunderstorm forecasts moving across Austrlia](/blog-images/creating-a-gif/out2-opt.gif)
